- When do customers prefer to travel? Are weekends or weekdays busier? 📅  
- How does pricing vary across cities, and what impact does it have on demand? 💸

- How can GoodCabs optimize driver deployment and marketing efforts based on data? 🚦  

By tackling these questions, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of GoodCabs’ operations.
